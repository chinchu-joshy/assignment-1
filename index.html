            Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. 
            Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
             Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons.

            The lion is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. 
            It is most recognisable for its muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, 
            round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
            adult male lions have a prominent mane.

                 Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, 
        in part, the simians of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates,
         such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.
